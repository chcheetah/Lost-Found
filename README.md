<pre>

The App that helps you find your lost items, on campus. :)

# What this app is about:

Suppose you lose any personal belongings, on campus. You can then fill out a simple form, describing your item, and giving your contact details.

Then, the app would store this onto an cloud hosted SQL server, which can be accessed by other people using the app, to see any lost items.
